## Alternative: Command Line Access

If you prefer terminal commands:
```bash
# List all files
docker exec localstack awslocal s3 ls s3://cosmicspace-media/ --recursive

# Download a file
docker exec localstack awslocal s3 cp s3://cosmicspace-media/[path] ./local-file

# Upload a file
docker exec localstack awslocal s3 cp ./local-file s3://cosmicspace-media/[path]
```

## Troubleshooting

If connection fails:
1. Ensure LocalStack is running: `docker ps | grep localstack`
2. Start LocalStack if needed: `npm run localstack:start`
3. Check port 4566 is accessible: `curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health`

## Note

Files are stored inside the Docker container and will be lost if you run `docker-compose down -v`. To persist files, add a volume mount to your docker-compose configuration.
